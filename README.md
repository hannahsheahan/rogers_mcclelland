# rogers_mcclelland

This is an implementation an analogy model introduced in _Rogers & McClelland (2008), Precis of Semantic Cognition: A Parallel Distributed Processing Approach. Brain and Behav Sciences._ Here I explore the effects of shared structure across domains on the degree of sharing (although its in development!).

Note that the full implementation is in python, but there are also MATLAB scripts I made for creating the datasets (before remembering how much easier life is with pytorch!). Would suggest working with the .py and ignoring the .m
